SightAid : Virtual Assistant for Vision Impaired
## Introduction
In today's smartphone-centric world, addressing the challenges faced by individuals with visual impairments is crucial. The Braille Keyboard project seeks to enhance accessibility and inclusivity for the visually challenged in navigating the digital landscape. 
Inspired by the widespread use of smartphones, the project aims not just to introduce technology but to create a more equitable digital experience. Its goal is to empower visually impaired individuals, ensuring they can fully utilize smartphones without feeling excluded. The Braille Keyboard goes beyond accommodation, offering a platform for independence in the digital age.

## Alignment with Guardian angel 
Existing Braille keyboard solutions are primarily tailored for iOS, leaving Android users at a disadvantage. The Braille Keyboard project breaks through these limitations, catering to both iOS and Android platforms, expanding accessibility. Beyond traditional Braille keyboards, this project incorporates gestures, transforming it into a comprehensive communication tool. 
With a focus on a seamless experience, it strives to set a new standard for digital accessibility. Inspired by the concept of a "Guardian Angel," the project aims to be a benevolent force, aiding those inadvertently left behind by rapid technological evolution. By aligning with inclusivity, independence, and accessibility, the Braille Keyboard aspires to empower the visually challenged.


## Specifications

- *User Interaction*: The user interacts with the mobile application by tapping the Braille buttons or using predefined gestures on the gesture pad.
- *Gesture Recognition*: The Gesture Recognition Module captures and interprets user gestures. 
- Braille Translation: The Braille Translation Engine processes the Braille input generated by button presses or gestures, converting it into corresponding text. This can be either from contracted braille or uncontracted braille.
- *Text Processing*: The Text Processing Module handles the converted text, allowing users to perform various functions such as generating speech, copying text, and constructing messages.
- *User Output*: The final output is presented to the user through the mobile application's user interface, in terms of audio representation or posted in the clipboard.

## Design

**Component Architecture Overview**
- *User Interface (UI)*: 
  - Baille Buttons: Six buttons labeled 1-6, each with contrasting colors.
  - Gesture Pad: A dedicated section for recognizing gestures.
  - Text Display: Area to display converted text and user feedback.
- *Gesture Recognition Module*: 
  - The Gesture Recognition Module in the Braille Keyboard project was seamlessly implemented using Android Studio's built-in features. 
  - Gestures include swiping right for space, swiping left for backspace, double-tapping to construct a letter(uncontracted Braille), swiping down for text-to-speech, swiping up to copy text, and long-press for words(contracted Braille).
- *Braille Translation Engine*: 
  - Processes Braille button presses and converts them into text.
  - Maps Braille input to appropriate characters based on the button pressed.

## Tech Stack
- *Mobile Framework*: The mobile framework for the Braille Keyboard project is Android Studio. Leveraging the robust development environment provided by Android Studio ensures seamless integration with Android devices, offering a tailored and optimized user experience. 
- *Braille Translation Engine*: The Braille Translation Engine, a critical component of the project, is implemented in Java. Utilizing the versatile capabilities of Java allows for efficient and platform-independent Braille translation. Additionally, the engine is integrated with SQLite for database functionality, ensuring a structured and reliable data management system.
- *Gesture Recognition*: Gesture recognition, a key feature of the Braille Keyboard, is seamlessly incorporated using Android Studio's built-in features. Leveraging the native gesture detection capabilities of Android Studio enhances the overall user experience by providing accurate and responsive recognition of user gestures. This ensures a natural and intuitive interaction for users of the Braille Keyboard application.

## Testing Strategies
- *Unit Testing*: The Braille Keyboard project conducts thorough unit testing on specific modules like Braille Translation Engine, Gesture Recognition Module, and Text Processing Module. This ensures that each component functions correctly in isolation, allowing early identification and resolution of specific issues.

- *Integration Testing*: Integration testing evaluates the interaction between different components, such as integrating the Braille Translation Engine with the Gesture Recognition Module. This phase ensures smooth communication and data flow between modules, addressing potential integration issues.

- *User Testing*: Usability testing is a key focus, involving simulated real-world scenarios and active participation of visually impaired individuals. Their feedback on the user interface and overall experience helps refine the design, ensuring the Braille Keyboard is intuitive and effective for its intended audience.

## Navigating challenges 
- The development of the Braille Keyboard faced hurdles, notably in gesture recognition and integrating contracted Braille.
- To overcome gesture recognition challenges, the team conducted user studies, fine-tuning the system based on natural gestures. For contracted Braille, a detailed study of user preferences and data structures ensured an integrated and efficient solution.
- Continuous user engagement and an iterative development approach emerged as key lessons. Flexibility in adapting to evolving user needs has become a guiding principle, shaping the Braille Keyboard into a user-centric, inclusive solution for the visually impaired.
